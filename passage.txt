Machine learning is a scientific discipline that explores the construction and study of algorithms that can learn from data.[1] Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs and using that to make predictions or decisions,[2]:2 rather than following strictly static program instructions. Machine learning is closely related to and often overlaps with computational statistics; a discipline which also specializes in prediction-making.
