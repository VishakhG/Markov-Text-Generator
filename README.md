# Markov-Text-Generator
A trigram Markov model to generate random text from wikipedia or file

A second-order Markov Model to generate random text by using a wikipedia page and all linked pages
or a text file. Specify the generation of words vs characters, wiki page to extract, file paths as command line
arguments. If the model is trained using characters, then the probability of a given passage being generated can be 
computed (The trained model will not be general enough if it generates words  to make this computation ).
